## 🎯 Project Goal

The main objective of this project is **learning**. I built this to practice:
* Structuring complex HTML layouts.
* Implementing modern CSS visual effects (glows, gradients, glassmorphism).
* Replicating professional UI/UX designs with precision.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Modern Dark Theme:** A deep black background with subtle gradient overlays.
* **Advanced CSS Backgrounds:**
    * Custom grid patterns using `linear-gradient`.
    * Ambient glow effects using `radial-gradient` and `filter: blur()`.
* **Glassmorphism:** Navigation bar features a frosted glass effect using `backdrop-filter`.
* **CSS Grid & Flexbox:** utilized for complex layouts like the "Bento-style" feature cards and the footer grid.
* **Typography:** sophisticated type hierarchy using the **Inter** font family.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Custom properties, Flexbox, Grid, and pseudo-elements (`::before`, `::after`).
* **Fonts:** Google Fonts (Inter).
